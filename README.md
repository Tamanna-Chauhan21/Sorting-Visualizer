# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Java Swing) ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š  
Visualize 6+ sorting algorithms in real-time with interactive controls and animations  

## ðŸ“Œ Description  
An interactive Java Swing application that visualizes fundamental sorting algorithms using Data Structures and Algorithms principles. Features:  
- Real-time animations with color-coded comparisons/swaps  
- Adjustable speed (1x to 100x) and dataset size (10-150 elements)  
- Thread-safe visualization using AtomicBoolean for smooth operation  
- Side-by-step execution of 6+ algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, etc.)  

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- Multi-Algorithm Support:  
  - O(nÂ²): Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort  
  - O(n log n): Merge, Quick, Heap Sort  
- Interactive Controls:  
  - Dynamic speed adjustment during sorting  
  - Real-time array size modification  
  - Start/Stop/Restart functionality  
- Visual Enhancements:  
  - Responsive bar rendering with dynamic width  
  - Smooth animations with configurable delays  
  - Thread-safe UI updates via SwingUtilities  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- Core Java: Multithreading, AtomicBoolean, Event Listeners  
- Swing Components: JSlider, JComboBox, Custom JPanel rendering  
- Algorithms: Full implementations of 6 sorting techniques  
- Concurrency: Worker threads for non-blocking UI
